“However, Subhūti, this is the way in which a bodhisattva should engage in the giving away of gifts for the benefit of al
l living beings, but any idea of a living being is indeed idealess.All living beings of whom the Realized One has preach
ed are indeed beingless.The Realized One, Subhūti, speaks truly, the Realized One tells the truth, he tells things as th
ey are, the Realized One does not tell lies.
