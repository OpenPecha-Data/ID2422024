“If, however, some gentleman or lady were to take as many world-systems as there are dust-particles of earth in the triga
lactic megagalactic world-system, Subhūti, and grind them to powder, so that they were like, say, a pile of the most min
ute atoms, what do you think, Subhūti? Would that pile of the most minute atoms be considerable?”He said, “Quite so, Lor
d, that pile of the most minute atoms would be considerable.Why is that? If, Lord, there were a pile, the Lord would not
say ‘pile of the most minute atoms.’Why is that? Any pile of the most minute atoms which has been preached has been pre
ached as pile-less by the Lord. That is why it is called ‘a pile of the most minute atoms.’
