Would all the dust of the earth, Subhūti, that there is in the trigalactic megagalactic world-system be a lot?”Subhūti sa
id, “Lord, the dust of that much earth would be a lot. Any dust of the earth preached by the Realized One, Lord, has bee
n preached by the Realized One as dustless. Thus it is called ‘the dust of the earth.’ Any world-system there is has bee
n preached by the Realized One as systemless. Thus it is called ‘a world-system.’”
