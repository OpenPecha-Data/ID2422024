Furthermore, the Lord said this to the Venerable Subhūti,“What do you think, Subhūti? Is there anything whatsoever that t
he Realized One has fully awakened to, or any dharma whatsoever that the Realized One has taught, as supreme and perfect
awakening?”Subhūti said, “Lord, as I understand the meaning of what the Lord has preached, there is no dharma whatsoeve
r that the Realized One has fully awakened to, nor any dharma whatsoever that the Realized One has taught, as supreme an
d perfect awakening.Why is that? The dharma which the Realized One has taught is ungraspable, it is ineffable, it is nei
ther a dharma nor a non-dharma.Why is that? Because the Noble Persons are distinguished by the power they derive from th
e unconditioned.”
