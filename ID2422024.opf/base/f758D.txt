“Should anyone say, Subhūti, that the Realized One has fully awakened to supreme and perfect awakening, [he would be spea
king a falsehood,]1 there is no dharma whatsoever to which the Realized One has fully awakened as supreme and perfect aw
akening.In the dharma to which the Realized One has fully awakened, there is no truth and no falsehood. Therefore the Re
alized One preaches ‘All dharmas are Buddha-dharmas.’As far as ‘all dharmas’ are concerned, Subhūti, all of them are dha
rma-less. That is why they are called ‘all dharmas.’
