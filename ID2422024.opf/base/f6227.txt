“What do you think, Subhūti? Can a Realized One be seen by virtue of the perfection of his physical body?”He said, “No, L
ord, a Realized One cannot be seen by virtue of the perfection of his physical body.Why is that? The so-called ‘perfecti
on of the physical body’ has been preached by the Realized One as perfectionless. That is why it is called the ‘perfecti
on of the physical body.’”
