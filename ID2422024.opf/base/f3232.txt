This is the word as I heard it once when the Lord was staying in Śrāvastī, in Jetṛ’s Grove, at the monastery of Anāthapiṇ
ḍada, together with a large community of monks 1,250 monks strong.Then the Lord got dressed in the morning, took his bow
l and robe, and entered the great city of Śrāvastī for alms.Then, after walking around the great city of Śrāvastī for al
ms, the Lord returned in the afternoon after eating the alms food, washed his feet, and sat down on the seat set out for
him with legs crossed, body held erect and attention directed in front of him.Then a great many monks approached the Lo
rd, and after approaching him they prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, circumambulated the Lord three times, and s
at down to one side.
