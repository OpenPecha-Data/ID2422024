The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? If there were just as many Ganges Rivers as there are grains of sand in the G
anges River, would the grains of sand in them be numerous?”Subhūti said, “That many Ganges Rivers alone would be numerou
s, Lord, to say nothing of the grains of sand in them.”The Lord said, “I’ll tell you, Subhūti, I’ll have you know—if the
re were as many world-systems as there would be grains of sand in those Ganges Rivers, and some woman or man were to fil
l them with the seven treasures and make a gift of them to the Realized, Worthy and Perfectly Awakened Ones, what do you
think, Subhūti, would that woman or man generate a lot of merit on that basis?”Subhūti said, “A lot, Lord, a lot, Bless
ed One. That woman or man would generate a lot of merit on that basis.”The Lord said, “If, however, someone were to fill
that many world-systems with the seven treasures and make a gift of them, Subhūti, and if someone were to do no more th
an learn just a four-lined verse from this round of teachings and teach it to others, the latter would generate from tha
t a lot more merit, an immeasurable and incalculable amount.
