The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Does it occur to the Realized One that he has taught the dharma? Subhūti, any
body who would say such things as ‘The Tathāgata has taught the dharma’ would misrepresent me, Subhūti, on account of wr
ong learning.Why is that? As for the so-called ‘teaching of the dharma,’ Subhūti, there exists no dharma whatsoever whic
h can be apprehended called the teaching of the dharma.”
