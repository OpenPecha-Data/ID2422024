The Lord said, “What do you think, Subhūti? Would it occur to a Once-returner that he has obtained the fruit of a Once-re
turner?”Subhūti said, “No indeed, Lord. It does not occur to a Once-returner that he has obtained the fruit of a Once-re
turner. What is the reason for that? Because there is no dharma whatsoever which enters the state of being a Once-return
er. That is why one is called ‘a Once-returner.’”
